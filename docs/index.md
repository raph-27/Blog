# <h1 style="text-align: center;"> Who Am I? </h1>

I'm Raphael De Luis, an IT enthusiast with practical experience in network engineering, system administration, and technical support, now actively focused on cloud technologies. I earned my Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Quezon City University, and began my career at Trailblaizers Solutions Inc., where I transitioned from intern to full-time staff. There, I supported over 200 clients and contributed to the design and deployment of scalable IT and network solutions.

To continuously expand my expertise, Iâ€™ve earned certifications in AWS Cloud, Fortinet, Ruijie, and more. I maintain a dedicated home lab running Proxmox, NAS, and cloud-integrated enterprise simulations, where I explore concepts such as hybrid networking, infrastructure automation, and cloud security.

What drives me is the opportunity to be part of a team that builds reliable, scalable, and innovative solutions in the cloud. I am energized by the challenges and limitless potential of cloud computing and committed to supporting organizations in harnessing its full capabilities.
